# Authorization Server

The authorization server used to issue authorizations for Open Payments actions.
Implements Open Payments authorization endpoints in accordance with the GNAP spec for an AS:

- https://github.com/interledger/open-payments/blob/v1.0/openapi/auth-server.yaml
- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) configured to [run as non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)

## Docker build

In order to build the docker container run the following command.

```shell
# from the root
docker build -f packages/auth/Dockerfile -t rafiki-auth .
```

## GNAP Endpoints

The authorization service extends the following endpoints:

- `POST /`: Initializes a grant request for a client.
- `POST /continue/:id`: Continues a grant request after a resource owner has authorized said grant request.
- `POST /token/:id`: Rotates an access token and issues a new one.
- `DEL /token/:id`: Revokes an access token.

## Introspection endpoint

The introspection service extends the following endpoint:

- `POST /`: Performs introspection of an access token and determines if it is valid.
